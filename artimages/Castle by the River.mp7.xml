                            This fairy tale piece was the result of an artists’ contest 
                            between Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Clemens Brentano. Carl Gropius, 
                            one of the guests at a certain soirée in Schinkel’s house reports: 
                            “The question arose as to the difficulty of expressing in a drawing 
                            what could be so easily achieved through poetry. Schinkel refuted 
                            this and Brentano wanted to prove that he could easily improvise a 
                            narrative on the spot that Schinkel would by no stretch of the i
                            magination be able to keep up with or adequately express through 
                            drawing. After much discussion to and fro, and after the length of 
                            any such narrative had been agreed, it was decided — to the company’s 
                            loud delight — that the two should be put to the test. Brentano spoke 
                            and Schinkel drew.” Brentano’s story was about an old castle-like hunting 
                            lodge in which a head forester, now dead, had once lived. Because the
                            ground was so rocky, he was buried on the other bank of the river. 
                            And now a deer could safely come into the grounds of the deserted castle. 
                            Schinkel’s painting perfectly conveyed the complicated structure of 
                            Brentano’s narrative. As in the narrative, there are various layers of 
                            meaning in the painting with the symbols of a religious-Romantic 
                            worldview in the crucifix, church, burial, dove, wine, and children. 
                            But the transience of all things earthly as well as the idea of nature 
                            reclaiming the world also find formal expression in this painting 
                            which the art collector Consul Wagener commissioned from Schinkel 
                            on the basis of two drawings he made during the contest.

                                <FreeTextAnnotation>Karl Friedrich Schinkel was the foremost Prussian architect, 
                                city planner and a painter. From 1772 to 1800 he studied architecture under 
                                Friedrich Gilly and his father in Berlin. After a journey to Italy, he began 
                                work as an independent painter in 1805. In 1816 he created the scenery for Mozart’s opera
                                The Magic Flute, including the stage for the Queen of the Night scene, adorned with 
                                stars, which has since become iconic. Despite such successes, he decided to devote 
                                himself to architecture. He became famous as one of the most prominent German 
                                architects and created Neoclassical as well as Neo-Gothic buildings, mainly in Berlin 
                                and surrounding towns. Well known landmarks of his making include the Berlin Altes Museum 
                                on Museum Island, the Neue Wache (1816–18) and the Schauspielhaus (1819–21) at Gendarmenmarkt. 
                                In 1826 he also produced the plans for Charlottenhof Palace and St. Nikolaikirche, both in 
                                Potsdam. His style stands out for its pronounced Greek influence, while in his later years 
                                he applied Neo-Gothic elements such as can be seen in the brickwork of Friedrichswerder 
                                Church (1824–31).</FreeTextAnnotation>
